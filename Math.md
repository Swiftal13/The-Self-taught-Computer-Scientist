## Binary
A binary number is a number in the **base 2 numberal system**<br>
```a numeral system is a writing system for expressing numbers```<br><br>

Base 2: only two digits: **0 and 1**<br>
A binary digit is called a bit. 01101, 1 is a bit<br>
the number system represents how many digits there are.<br>
We use base 10, as we count with numbers 1 to 9<br><br>

the same number can be in many different bases. Therefore to indicate what base a number is in, programmers use specific notation.<br>
```100b %1000 b100```

**A place value** is the numerical value a digit has becuase of its position<br>
1543. the number 5 has a place value of 100<br>
The decimal system, each place value is a power of 10<br>
10^0 = 1
10^1 = 10
10^2 = 100 and so on<br><br>

## Bitewise operators
operator to peform operations on individual bits of binary representations of numbers<br>
they work at a **Binary level**<br>

```bin``` to work with binary numbers in python, returns binary value of number<br>

**And** operator peforms Boolean arithmetic bit by bit<br> It is like python ``and``. Both conditions must be true, for result to be True, else False<br>
When both bits are 1 (True), returns 1(True)<br>
When both or one is 0 (False), returns 0 (False)
