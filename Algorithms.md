# Algorithms

Every algorithm has 3 qualities
- <b>Definiteness</b>: the steps are clear, concise and unambiguous
- <b>Effectiveness</b>: you can peform each operation precisely to solve the problem
- <b>Finiteness</b>: algorithm stops after a finite number of steps

The magnitude of algorithms are measured by <b>Time and Space complexity</b><br>
A complexity is symbolised using the <b>big O notation</b>
