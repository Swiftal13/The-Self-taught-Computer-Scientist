# Algorithms

Every algorithm has 3 qualities
- <b>Definiteness</b>: the steps are clear, concise and unambiguous
- <b>Effectiveness</b>: you can peform each operation precisely to solve the problem
- <b>Finiteness</b>: algorithm stops after a finite number of steps

The magnitude of algorithms are measured by <b>Time and Space complexity</b><br>
A complexity is symbolised using the <b>big O notation</b>

<u>Time complexity</u><br>
- Time complexity is used to represent the magnitude of the run time of the algorithm, the time for the steps taken in an algorithm
- it is useful to show the efficiency of an algorithm

Each complexity in descending efficiency<br>
Constant O(1)<br>
Logarithmic O(log n)<br>
Linear O(n)<br>
Log Linear O(n log n)<br>
Quadratic O(n^2)<br>
Cubic O(n^3)<br>
exponential O(a^n) such as 2^n<br><br>


<b>Space complexity</b><br>

Space complexity is the amount of memory an algorithm uses depending on its input size<br>
- It is comprised of the auxillary space and input space
- must be considered when their is a memory limit<br><br>

# Best and Worst case
Within algorithms there is a **best and worst case**<br><br>
A best case scenario is the **best possible input**, which takes the **least time** and most efficient process<br>
A worst case scenario is the **worst possible input**, which takes the **most amount of time** and least efficient<br>

There is also an average case which are the average inputs and average run time
