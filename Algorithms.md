# Algorithms

Every algorithm has 3 qualities
- <b>Definiteness</b>: the steps are clear, concise and unambiguous
- <b>Effectiveness</b>: you can peform each operation precisely to solve the problem
- <b>Finiteness</b>: algorithm stops after a finite number of steps

The magnitude of algorithms are measured by <b>Time and Space complexity</b><br>
A complexity is symbolised using the <b>big O notation</b>

<u>Time complexity</u><br>
- Time complexity is used to represent the magnitude of the run time of the algorithm, the time for the steps taken in an algorithm
- it is useful to show the efficiency of an algorithm

Each complexity in descending efficiency
Constant O(1)
Logarithmic O(log n)
Linear O(n)
Log Linear O(n log n)
Quadratic O(n^2)
Cubic O(n^3)
