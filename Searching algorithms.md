## Searching algorithms

Linear search<br>

Linear search is a sequential searching algorithm<br>
- You look at each value one by one, comparing to the value your looking for<br>
- if a value does not match, move onto the next one
- do this till you have gone through the whole list

```py
for i in list:
  if i == 5:
      return True
  else:
    pass
```

Efficient for small lists, can work on both ordered and unordered lists
