# Algorithms

Every algorithm has 3 qualities
- Definiteness: the steps are clear, concise and unambiguous
- Effectiveness: you can peform each operation precisely to solve the problem
- Finiteness: algorithm stops after a finite number of steps

The magnitude of algorithms are measured by Time and Space complexity
A complexity is symbolised using the big O notation
