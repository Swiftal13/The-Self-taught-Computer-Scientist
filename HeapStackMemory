# Stack memory
Memory usage mechanism allows system memory to be used in FIFO structure

laguages like c++ and java can allocate memory 
allocation happens on contigious blocks of memory
it is a stack memory allocation because frames of memory are appended to a call stack 

whenever a new function is called memory is temporarily added to a stack FIFO data strutcure
