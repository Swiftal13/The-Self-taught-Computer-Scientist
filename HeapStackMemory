# Stack memory
Memory usage mechanism allows system memory to be used in LIFO structure


like we said in recursion, a stack is used to allocate memory for function calls.
**A call stack**


laguages like c++ and java can allocate memory 
allocation happens on contigious blocks of memory
it is a stack memory allocation because frames of memory are appended to a call stack 
they say a stack "grows downwards""

whenever a new function is called memory is temporarily added to a stack FIFO data strutcure
